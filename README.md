# Adjust monitors positions and hz in hyperland 
* I am tired of rebooting my system each time I'm connected to a new monitor using HDMI, I didn't know that hyperland configure this in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf`,
* So I made this script to adjust that to what ever I need using `hyprctl keyword monitor` 
* This script just deal with one monitor connected at "HDMI-A-3", as I just have one monitor, If I needed more I will edit the script.
